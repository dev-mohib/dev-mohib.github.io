Hi! I'm a full-stack developer with 5 years of experience. This is my story of becoming a programmer that everybody loves to share with his community. I'm trying to answer those questions raised in my mind as of now.

- How did I come to know about programming?
- Why did I choose to become a programmer?
- How do I get started in programming?
- Difference between my educational institute learning and self-learning
- How do I stay consistent in programming?
- At what stage do I consider myself a successful programmer?

# How did I come to know about programming

Well, It started in my school life in early 2014 when I came to know about programming as a computer science subject. The second half part of the subject was all about programming. I had my first interaction with a programming language which was **GW-BASIC**. I started playing with this language and learned the basic concepts, I still remember **FOR NEXT Loop, WHILE WEND Loop** which I used to play, and having some fun stuff with that. But that was not the time I started thinking about becoming a programmer, That was just my school time and I was not serious about building something great on a black-and-white console. But I got another chance to learn the basics of a high-level language **C** where I learned more programming concepts in the next year of my secondary education.

# Why did I choose to become a programmer?

Back in 2014-15 at the age of 16, I was a guy who used to play video games and indoor stuff. Talking about the profession I never thought of becoming a salesman, a 9 to 5 guy, or XX, I always preferred working without leaving my personal space because I could play games and do my favorite stuff in my free time. I started finding different ways of earning online, I found many options including blog writing which I'm writing today in 2022 :). I could select any other option except programming even though I tried online watching ads, taking surveys, completing tasks, etc, and earned a few $$. I also came to know about freelancing and started to understand the platforms offering these types of services and I also came to know about Fiverr. I explored Fiverr and found that it's not a free money-making machine that will pay you for your entire life until you don't offer something that somebody else is looking for. So asking the following questions myself

**How can I get paid without leaving my space?**

*Working Online*

**What do I love to do and never get bored?**

*Sitting for hours in front of the computer*

**What skills match my interests and I can be crazy about them?**

*Building some kind of software, etc*

**Can I build my own business with that skill?**

*Could be Yes*

So after brainstorming all these scenarios, I found an option that underlined all these cases and that was `PROGRAMMING`

# How do I get started in programming?

In 2017 at the age of 18, I already learned basic programming in the **C** language, Now I was looking to create an application where the user can interact via its user interface rather than typing commands and getting very simple programs such as

`sum of two numbers is: ___`

which I learned in **C** language. Then I found javascript, I watched some video tutorials, [Here](https://youtu.be/fju9ii8YsGs) is the link to the first video I watched to learn the basics of javascript, I would thank [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/c/derekbanas) who was the tutor of my early following. Then I started playing with JavaScript along with designing UI's using HTML and CSS. I started diving further and found client-server architecture development further divides the development into frontend development and backend development but I selected full stack development. That is how I got started in programming and set a way of becoming a self-taught developer.

# Difference between my educational institute learning and self-learning

I have also completed my CS degree, where I learned the most important things that I could miss while learning on my own. In my experience, You are still in trouble if you complete your CS degree but you don't do self-learning. Because I learned many important subjects, such as Data Structures and algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Data Science & security. You still need to learn many things on your own because every day we wake up and we see new technologies and concepts etc. There are a lot more tools that are not included in these institute's outlines.

# How do I stay consistent in programming?

There are many factors involved in the consistency because

# At what stage do I consider myself a successful programmer?

During my learning phase even though I had many achievements like I was appreciated as a good programmer, I created some really interesting things while learning. An example is, that I created a small virus program that creates thousands of random binary files and other malicious effects on the computer while I was in my very initial learning stage. This doesn't show that I succeeded in what I've planned just a year ago. Real achievement is when you build something real that is useful for the purpose you have built. So, after doing a lot of practice, and understanding concepts, I built some basic apps such as a user authentication system in the MERN stack, a basic weather app, etc. I was a bit confident to start offering my services to the clients. I tried and won a small project that was Linkedin OAuth implementation in a website built on Wix and I failed. But I was happy that at least I tried and also it was my first try to work on something real. After a few months of struggle, I finally landed a remote job in 2019 and worked for a company for almost six months, then I created complete applications from scratch without the team and I became financially independent. You might be thinking that I'd have been considered a successful programmer at this stage. The answer is No, Not Yet. The stage I considered myself to be a successful programmer was when I started helping out my community, I started adding my answers on StackOverflow issues, and one of my answers was marked as a green check.
