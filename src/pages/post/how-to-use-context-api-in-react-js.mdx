# Overview

If you want to create an application you are required to use global state management. You will probably install redux and you have to write a lot of boilerplate code and overwhelming stuff for basic store implementation which is still fine but it will also increase the build size of your application because of installing external libraries like **redux, react-redux, @ redux/toolkit **, etc. React context API is already providing a great way to manage your state across all the components. In this tutorial, I'm using a very simple way to implement useContext API and useReducer hook to create a simple global state like a redux reducer.

To start with:

# What is Context API?

Context API is used to share data between components without props drilling which means passing data to the children and then further down its children. which becomes chaotic and makes the code more complex, Its built-in API in React which is good for the performance of the application.

# What is useReducer Hook?

To understand the useReducer hook. First, we need to understand what is the reducer.

> A reducer is a pure function that takes state and action as a parameter and returns a newly modified state according to the action passed to it.
> 

Now,

> the useReducer hook is used to define the reducers of peace of a state in your application. It also accepts two parameters, initial state, and reducer function within the body of useState hook and returns state and dispatch properties. Here is the example of using useReducer hook
> 

```jsx
const initialState = []
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "ADD":
            return [...state, action.payload]
        case "COMPLETE":
            return state.map((todo) => {
            if (todo.id === action.id) {
                return { ...todo, isComplete: !todo.isComplete };
            } else {
                return todo;
            }
            });

      default:
        return state;
    }
  };
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(initialState, reducer)
```

# Step-by-Step Implementation

Let's create a new react project by running `npx create-react-app react-context` or `yarn create vite` and select React Project. I'm creating a very simple todo context in this example

Now, we have a blank project. create a new file under **src/context/todoContext.jsx**. I'm creating a React component with context implementation which will be used as the parent component of the application. I'm creating two contexts one for getting the state values and the other for setting the values i.e. reducer. Also add useReducer code which I've explained above

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useReducer } from "react"

export const TodoContext = createContext(null)
export const TodoDispatchContext = createContext(null)

const TodoProvider = ({children}) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(initialState, reducer)

  return(
      <TodoContext.Provider value={state}>
            <TodoDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>
                {children}
            </TodoDispatchContext.Provider>
        </TodoContext.Provider>
      )
}

export default TodoProvider
```

Now!

We have created the todo context. We import this component in our main entry file entry and wrap around the whole application

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import TodoProvider from './context/todoProvider'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <TodoProvider>
        <Todo />
    </TodoProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

Alright!

We have successfully created and wrapped our todo context in our application. Now we can get state and dispatch from anywhere inside the application. At this stage, we are using another hook called **useContex** since we are using the contexts that we created above. Let's see how it works

**src/components/todo.jsx**

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { TodoContext, TodoDispatchContext } from '../context/todoContext'

const Todos = () => {
    const todos = useContext(TodoContext)
    const dispatch = useContext(TodoDispatchContext)
  return (
    <div>
       {
          todos.map(todo => <div>
              <h2>{todo.text}</h2>
          </div>
          )
        }
    </div>
  )
}

export default Todos
```

Finally, Let's write some UI code to utilize the workflow of the state management.

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { TodoContext, TodoDispatchContext } from '../context/todoContext'

const Todos = () => {
    const todos = useContext(TodoContext)
    const dispatch = useContext(TodoDispatchContext)
  return (
    <div>
      {
        todos.map(todo => (
          <div className='todo-body'>
            <span className={todo.isCompleted ? "todo-completed" : "to-uncompleted"}>
              {todo.text}
            </span>
            <input type={"checkbox"} value={todo.isCompleted} onChange={(e) => dispatch({type : "COMPLETE", id : todo.id})} />
          </div>
        ))
      }
      <div className='add-todo'>
        <input type={"text"} value={todoText} onChange={(e) => setTodoText(e.target.value)} />
        <button className='add-btn' onClick={() => {
            dispatch(
              {
                type : "ADD", payload : {
                text : todoText,
                id : Date.now() //This returns timestamp as a unique number and I'm using this as id
              }
             })
        }}>Add TODO</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Todos
```
