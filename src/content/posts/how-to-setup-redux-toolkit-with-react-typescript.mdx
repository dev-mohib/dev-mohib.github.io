Have you ever disinclined while implementing redux in your React app? You are not the only one who has this problem. Redux has a lot of boilerplates to set before configuring a store to collect and manage all data in a single place. But, a library has arrived to fix all these confusing setups to configure in the app. Redux toolkit makes our state management with redux a lot easier than the older technique to the store. In this article, I'm writing about the Redux toolkit and the step-by-step procedure to implement Redux with typescript support.

# What is redux

I'm not explaining the complete concept of redux but here are a few main points of redux in my head

- It's a global state management tool for storing all the application data in a single place
- It's also called the single source of truth
- It works like a useState in the react component but as a global to **get** and **set** values from anywhere in the app.

# What is Redux Toolkit

Redux toolkit is a simple library that includes simple utilities to simplify common use cases in redux such as store setup, creating reducers, immuting state of the store, and a lot more. The entire store is divided into multiple slices which creates a well-managed way to work with different parts of the store. The terminology of Redux : actions, reducers, store, dispatch, and connect can be implemented without much effort.

# Counter App Implementation Example

Here is the step-by-step guide to implementing a very basic counter app in the redux toolkit

## Step 1

1. create a react project by running `npx create-react-app counter-app -typescript` to initialize a new react project and quickly create a new folder inside the src directory called **state** where all the redux logic will be added.
2. install the following dependencies

`npm i redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit`

## Step 2: Implement Slice

create a file **counter_slice.ts** with the following lines of code to create a slice, This slice has everything for the redux store, actions, reducer, state, etc

```jsx
import {createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
interface CounterSlice = {
value : number
};
const initialState : CounterSlice = {
value : 0
}
export const counterSlice = createSlice({
   initialState,
    name : "counter_slice", //name of slice, also appears in redux chrome extension
    reducers : {
    increaseCounter : ( state ) => {
    state.value++
    },
    decreaseCounter : (state) => {
      state.value--
    },
    setFixedValue : (state, action : PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value = action.payload
    }
   }
})
```

## Step 3: Implement Store

create a file **store.ts** inside the state directory and import the counterSlice that you just created. I'm also exporting two hooks `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` with type directly from the store that we will use inside the react components with typescript

```jsx
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'
import { counterSlice } from "./sounter_slice"

//destructing reducer and actions from the slice
const { reducer, actions} = counterSlice

export const store = configureStore({
reducer : {
    counterSlice : reducer
  }
})
// Dispatch Hook
export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<typeof store.dispatch>()
// useSelector Hook, similar to useSelector with typescript
export const useAppSelector : TypedUseSelectorHook<ReturnType<typeof store.getState>> = useSelector

//export actions of counter slice for directly mutating inside the react components
export { increaseCounter, decreaseCounter, setFixedValue } = actions
```

## Step 4: Wrap the Application with the store provider Component

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import {store} from './state/store'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>
```

## Step 5: set or get from the state

Now open the App.js file

```jsx
import React from "react"
import {useAppDispatch, useAppSelector, increaseCounter, decreaseCounter, setFixedValue } from "../../state/store"

const App : React.FC = () => {
    const {value} = useAppSelector(state => state.counterSlice)
    const dispatch = useAppDispatch()
  return (
    <div>
        <h1>Counter Value : { value }</h1>

        <button
          onClick={() => dispatch(increaseCounter())}
         >
              Increament
         </button>
        <button
            onClick={() => dispatch(decreaseCounter())}
          >
               Decreament
        </button>

        <input type="number" value="Enter Number"
              onChange={(e) =>  dispatch(setFixedValue(parseInt(e.target.value)))}
         />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
